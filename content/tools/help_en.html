		<h4>Back and Next</h4>
		<p>Instead of a navigation bar with the “Back” and “Forward” buttons of a standard browser like Internet Explorer, some of MyAccount courses have "Back” and “Next” navigation buttons (shown as <&nbsp;and&nbsp;>) located at the top and bottom of the right hand side of the screen. Selecting the “&lt;” (or Back) button will take you to the previously viewed page and selecting the “&gt;” (or Next) button will bring you to the next page.</p>
